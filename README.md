# SAML
This Dockerfile is based on [jnyryan's image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jnyryan/simplesamlphp/) and configure's it so that it act as basic IdP. It was configured using [this guide](https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/simplesamlphp-idp).

You will need your own certificate (server.crt) and key (server.pem). [Here](https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/simplesamlphp-idp#section_4) is how to create it.
